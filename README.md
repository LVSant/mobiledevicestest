App developed for the Mobile Devices Development class at Faculty of Technology of UNICAMP

www.ft.unicamp.br

This app lets you associate a subject with a book, creating a bibliography.

The funcionality is not the point of the project, but the technologies used are the main focus.

The app uses only one activity, using the fragmentmanager to switch between them,
uses firebase messaging service for copying the server database for the local database, 
sincronizes with server database and local database for reducing data traffic,
uses Google CardView for showing books,
Picasso library (https://github.com/square/picasso) used to load and cache the books thumbnails.

The idea is to improve this app, apply design patterns (there are some design pattern issues) and the best practicies,
and in the future use it as a template for the technologies involved.
